### Links

- Live Site URL: [Loopstudios Page](hhttps://loop-studios-zeta.vercel.app/m)

## My Process üõ†Ô∏è

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript for interactive elements

### What I Learned

During this project, I deepened my understanding of responsive design and improved my CSS Grid skills. Here's a snippet of CSS I'm particularly proud of:

```css
.creations-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 30px;
}
```

This code creates a responsive grid layout that adjusts based on the viewport size.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I want to focus on:

- Improving my JavaScript skills for more complex interactions
- Exploring CSS animations to add subtle motion to the design
- Implementing accessibility features for a more inclusive user experience

### Useful Resources

- [CSS-Tricks Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This comprehensive guide helped me master Flexbox layouts.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - An invaluable resource for web development references and guides.
